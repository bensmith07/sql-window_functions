-- Guided Project: SQL Window Functions for Analytics
###############################################################
###############################################################

#############################
-- Task One: Getting Started
-- In this task, we will get started with the project
-- by retrieving all the data in the projectdb database
#############################

-- 1.1: Retrieve all the data in the projectdb database
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM departments;
SELECT * FROM regions;
SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM sales;

#############################
-- Task Two: Window Functions - Refresher
-- In this task, we will refresh our understanding
-- of using window functions in SQL
#############################

-- 2.1: Retrieve a list of employee_id, first_name, hire_date, 
-- and department of all employees ordered by the hire date
SELECT employee_id, first_name, department, hire_date,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS Row_N
FROM employees;

-- 2.2: Retrieve the employee_id, first_name, 
-- hire_date of employees for different departments


#############################
-- Task Three: Ranking
-- In this task, we will learn how to rank the
-- rows of a result set
#############################

-- 3.1: Recall the use of ROW_NUMBER()
SELECT first_name, email, department, salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY department
				  ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM employees;

-- 3.2: Let's use the RANK() function


-- Exercise 3.1: Retrieve the hire_date. Return details of
-- employees hired on or before 31st Dec, 2005 and are in
-- First Aid, Movies and Computers departments 
SELECT first_name, email, department, salary, ___
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department
			ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM employees
WHERE ___ AND department ___;

-- This returns how many employees are in each department
SELECT department, COUNT(*) dept_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY dept_count DESC;

-- 3.3: Return the fifth ranked salary for each department


-- Create a common table expression to retrieve the customer_id, 
-- and how many times the customer has purchased from the mall 
WITH purchase_count AS (
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(sales) AS purchase
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY purchase DESC
)

-- 3.4: Understand the difference between ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK
SELECT customer_id, purchase,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY purchase DESC) AS Row_N,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY purchase DESC) AS Rank_N,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY purchase DESC) AS Dense_Rank_N
FROM purchase_count
ORDER BY purchase DESC;

#############################
-- Task Four: Paging: NTILE()
-- In this task, we will learn how break/page
-- the result set into groups
#############################

-- 4.1: Group the employees table into five groups
-- based on the order of their salaries


-- 4.2: Group the employees table into five groups for 
-- each department based on the order of their salaries
SELECT first_name, email, department, salary,
NTILE(5) OVER(PARTITION BY department
			  ORDER BY salary DESC)
FROM employees;

-- Create a CTE that returns details of an employee
-- and group the employees into five groups
-- based on the order of their salaries
WITH salary_ranks AS (
SELECT first_name, email, department, salary,
NTILE(5) OVER(ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank_of_salary
FROM employees)

-- 4.3: Find the average salary for each group of employees


#############################
-- Task Five: Aggregate Window Functions - Part One
-- In this task, we will learn how to use
-- aggregate window functions in SQL
#############################

-- 5.1: This returns how many employees are in each department
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS dept_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY department;

-- 5.2: Retrieve the first names, department and 
-- number of employees working in that department
SELECT first_name, department, 
(SELECT COUNT(*) AS dept_count FROM employees e1 WHERE e1.department = e2.department)
FROM employees e2
GROUP BY department, first_name
ORDER BY department;

-- The solution


-- 5.3: Total Salary for all employees


-- 5.4: Total Salary for each department


-- Exercise 5.1: Total Salary for each department and
-- order by the hire date. Call the new column running_total
SELECT first_name, hire_date, department, salary,
___(___) OVER(___ ___
				 ___ ___) AS ___
FROM employees;

#############################
-- Task Six: Aggregate Window Functions - Part Two
-- In this task, we will learn how to use
-- aggregate window functions in SQL
#############################

-- Retrieve the different region ids
SELECT DISTINCT region_id
FROM employees;

-- 6.1: Retrieve the first names, department and 
-- number of employees working in that department and region


-- Exercise 6.1: Retrieve the first names, department and 
-- number of employees working in that department and in region 2
SELECT first_name, department, 
___ OVER(___ ___) AS dept_count
FROM employees
___ ___ = ___;

-- Create a common table expression to retrieve the customer_id, 
-- ship_mode, and how many times the customer has purchased from the mall
WITH purchase_count AS (
SELECT customer_id, ship_mode, COUNT(sales) AS purchase
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id, ship_mode
ORDER BY purchase DESC
)

-- Exercise 6.2: Calculate the cumulative sum of customers purchase
-- for the different ship mode
SELECT customer_id, ship_mode, purchase, 
___(___) OVER(___ ___
				   ORDER BY customer_id ASC) AS sum_of_sales
FROM purchase_count;


#############################
-- Task Seven: Window Frames - Part One
-- In this task, we will learn how to
-- order data in window frames in the result set
#############################

-- 7.1: Calculate the running total of salary

-- Retrieve the first_name, hire_date, salary
-- of all employees ordered by the hire date
SELECT first_name, hire_date, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date;

-- The solution


-- 7.2: Add the current row and previous row


-- 7.3: Find the running average


-- What do you think the result of the query will be?
SELECT first_name, hire_date, salary,
SUM(salary) OVER(ORDER BY hire_date 
				 ROWS BETWEEN
				 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM employees;

#############################
-- Task Eight: Window Frames - Part Two
-- In this task, we will learn how to
-- order data in window frames in the result set
#############################

-- 8.1: Review of the FIRST_VALUE() function
SELECT department, division,
FIRST_VALUE(department) OVER(ORDER BY department ASC) first_department
FROM departments;

-- 8.2: Retrieve the last department in the departments table


-- Create a common table expression to retrieve the customer_id, 
-- ship_mode, and how many times the customer has purchased from the mall
WITH purchase_count AS (
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(sales) AS purchase
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY purchase DESC
)

-- What do you think this will return?
SELECT customer_id, purchase, 
MAX(purchase) OVER(ORDER BY customer_id ASC) AS max_of_sales,
MAX(purchase) OVER(ORDER BY customer_id ASC
				  ROWS BETWEEN
				  CURRENT ROW AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS next_max_of_sales
FROM purchase_count;

#############################
-- Task Nine: GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP() & CUBE()
-- In this task, we will learn how the GROUPING SETS, 
-- ROLLUP, and CUBE clauses work in SQL
#############################

-- 9.1: Find the sum of the quantity for different ship modes
SELECT ship_mode, SUM(quantity) 
FROM sales
GROUP BY ship_mode;

-- 9.2: Find the sum of the quantity for different categories
SELECT category, SUM(quantity) 
FROM sales
GROUP BY category;

-- 9.3: Find the sum of the quantity for different subcategories
SELECT sub_category, SUM(quantity) 
FROM sales
GROUP BY sub_category;

-- 9.4: Use the GROUPING SETS clause
